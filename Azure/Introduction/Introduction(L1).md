Azure is Microsoft's online service that lets you store data, run software, and use other computing services over the internet instead of keeping them on your own computer.

### 2. Why Use Azure for Data Science?
Azure offers tools for data science that make it easy to analyze data, create models to understand that data, and get results without having to manage the technology on your own.

### 3. How Does Azure Work for Data Science?
You use Azure by logging into their website and choosing the data science tools you need, like data storage or machine learning services, and you only pay for what you use.

### 4. Use of Azure in Data Science
Data scientists use Azure to store huge amounts of data, find patterns in the data, and make predictions using that data, all on Microsoft's computers instead of their own.

### 5. Without It
Without Azure, you would have to buy and maintain your own computers to handle data tasks, which can be expensive and complicated.
